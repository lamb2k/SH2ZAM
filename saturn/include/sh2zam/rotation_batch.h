/** Rotate a complete vector batch by one quaternion. Results are bit-identical

 *  full-range quaternions, full-range vectors, flooring and saturation.
 *
 *  Quaternion normalization and matrix construction happen once per call.
 *  The ordinary implementation is the existing exact composition
 *  quat_to_mat34(q) followed by mat34_transform_points; the generated matrix
 *  has zero translation. This API makes that shared setup explicit, rather
 *  than promising a faster arithmetic kernel than the existing composition.
 *
 *  Exact in-place operation (out==in) is supported. Other input/output overlap,
 *  a byte count overflowing size_t, and nonempty null buffers return false
 *  before any output write. Zero count accepts null buffers and does no math.
 *  No allocation, persistent cache or mutable global state is used. */

 *  Out-of-place batches use the existing fused native kernel only when its
 *  range proof succeeds and the current CPU's SR.S bit is clear. In-place
 *  batches, unproved output ranges, SR.S=1, non-SH-2 builds and forced-portable
 *  builds use the ordinary matrix batch. SR is read and never modified.
 *  This is not the default entry point or physical-console qualification.
 *  Application ISRs using MACH/MACL must preserve both registers, as required
 *  by the library's existing native multiplication backend. */
